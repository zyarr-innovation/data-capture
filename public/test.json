Ice cream Man \n\nWhen summer’s in the city,\n And brick’s a blaze of heat, \nThe Ice-cream Man with his little cart \nGoes trundling down the street.\n\nBeneath his round umbrella, \nOh, what a joyful sight, \nTo see him fill the cones with mounds\n Of cooling brown and white: \nVanilla, chocolate, strawberry, \nOr chilly things to drink From bottles full of frosty-fizz,\n Green, orange, white, or pink.\nHis cart might be a flower bed, \nOf roses and sweet peas,\n The way the children cluster round As thick as honeybees.\n",
